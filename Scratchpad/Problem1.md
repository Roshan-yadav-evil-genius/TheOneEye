> **Organizations lack a system to precisely identify, reach, and activate the *decision-shaping personas* inside the *right-fit companies*, resulting in low first-level responses and stalled sales momentum.**

Three hidden failures are bundled inside:

* Company selection is fuzzy (regulatory obligation ≠ buying intent).
* Persona targeting is misaligned (contacted people cannot move the deal forward).
* Outreach infrastructure is weak (deliverability + relevance + timing).

This is exactly the kind of messy, cross-functional failure automation should own.

Below is a **goal-tracking table** reframed so TheOneEye is clearly solving a *category-level problem*, not a one-off client issue.

| 1. Q1 2026                 | Inability to systematically identify *right-fit companies* where regulatory, commercial, and timing signals indicate real buying intent                          | Q1 2026  | Planned |
| 2. Q1 2026                 | Lack of clear mapping between companies and the *actual decision-shaping personas* (economic buyer, technical validator, internal champion)                      | Q2 2026  | Planned |
| 3. Q2 2026                 | Low first-level response rates due to poor deliverability, weak personalization signals, and misaligned messaging                                                | Q2 2026  | Planned |
| 4. Q3 2026                 | Sales teams unable to consistently convert early interest into procurement-ready conversations due to absence of automated qualification and follow-up workflows | Q3 2026  | Planned |

Why this positioning is powerful:

* It scales across **industries**, not just sustainability.
* It reframes sales failure as a **systems problem**, not a people problem.
* It gives TheOneEye a mandate upstream of CRM and downstream of marketing—prime leverage territory.
