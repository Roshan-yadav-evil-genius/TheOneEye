> **Organizations lack a system to precisely identify, reach, and activate the *decision-shaping personas* inside the *right-fit companies*, resulting in low first-level responses and stalled sales momentum.**

Three hidden failures are bundled inside:

* Company selection is fuzzy (regulatory obligation ≠ buying intent).
* Persona targeting is misaligned (contacted people cannot move the deal forward).
* Outreach infrastructure is weak (deliverability + relevance + timing).

This is exactly the kind of messy, cross-functional failure automation should own.

Below is a **goal-tracking table** reframed so TheOneEye is clearly solving a *category-level problem*, not a one-off client issue.

| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1. Q1 2026                 | Inability to systematically identify *right-fit companies* where regulatory, commercial, and timing signals indicate real buying intent                          | Q1 2026  | Planned |
| 2. Q1 2026                 | Lack of clear mapping between companies and the *actual decision-shaping personas* (economic buyer, technical validator, internal champion)                      | Q2 2026  | Planned |
| 3. Q2 2026                 | Low first-level response rates due to poor deliverability, weak personalization signals, and misaligned messaging                                                | Q2 2026  | Planned |
| 4. Q3 2026                 | Sales teams unable to consistently convert early interest into procurement-ready conversations due to absence of automated qualification and follow-up workflows | Q3 2026  | Planned |

Why this positioning is powerful:

* It scales across **industries**, not just sustainability.
* It reframes sales failure as a **systems problem**, not a people problem.
* It gives TheOneEye a mandate upstream of CRM and downstream of marketing—prime leverage territory.

## Notes

1. What concrete methods and tactical workflows do organizations use to identify and qualify potential clients? Examine how teams operationalize prospect discovery across channels—especially the step-by-step tactics behind approaches like monitoring topic-specific LinkedIn posts, extracting intent signals from likes/comments, mapping those individuals to buying roles, and initiating outreach. Analyze both manual and automated techniques, including tools, decision criteria, sequencing, and common failure points, to understand what consistently converts attention into qualified conversations.
