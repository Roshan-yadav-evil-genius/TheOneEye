> Sales and growth teams struggle to identify the right persona to contact within target organizations to match a specific intent. The challenge arises because decision-making roles, titles, and responsibilities vary significantly from one company to another. As a result, teams often rely on assumptions or generic job titles, leading to wasted outreach, low response rates, and misaligned conversations. There is a lack of a systematic, intent-driven way to map organizational personas to the actual individuals who are most relevant for a given goal within each unique company context.
