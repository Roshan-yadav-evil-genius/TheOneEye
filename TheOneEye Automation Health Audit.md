# Automation Health Audit

### Find the failures before they find you

Most automation problems don't fail loudly.
They fail quietly — until revenue, data, or customer trust is already damaged.

The **Automation Health Audit** is a short, focused review of the workflows your business depends on, designed to surface hidden risks and ownership gaps.

This is not a sales demo.
It's an operational reality check.

## What We Audit

We review your existing automations across five critical areas:

* **Business-Critical Workflows**
  Which processes matter most to revenue and operations?

* **Failure Points**
  Where can workflows break due to API limits, UI changes, credentials, logic gaps, data processing errors, or intelligence failures?

* **Ownership & Accountability**
  Who is responsible when something fails — and is that ownership clear?

* **Monitoring & Recovery**
  How are failures detected, and how quickly can normal operation be restored?

* **Tool & Dependency Risk**
  Where your business relies on fragile integrations or manual intervention

## What You Get

At the end of the audit, you receive:

* A clear map of your automation risk
* A list of workflows that require active ownership
* Identification of silent failure points
* Practical recommendations — not theory
* A decision-ready summary you can act on immediately

No jargon. No dashboards. Just clarity.

## Who This Is For

This audit is ideal for founders who:

* Rely on automation to generate or process revenue
* Feel uneasy about whether systems are “actually working”
* Want fewer operational surprises
* Are tired of being the fallback plan

If automation matters to your business, this audit will surface the truth.

## What This Is Not

* Not a tool walkthrough
* Not a generic checklist
* Not a hard sales pitch

You’ll leave with insight whether or not you continue with us.

---

## What Happens Next

After the audit, you choose what to do:

* Fix issues internally
* Ask us to manage specific workflows
* Or do nothing — now fully informed

No pressure. No lock-in.
