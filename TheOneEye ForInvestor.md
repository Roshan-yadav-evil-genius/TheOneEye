### Managed Automation for Businesses That Can’t Afford Silent Failures

**TheOneEye builds and operates business-critical automations and takes responsibility for keeping them running.**

Most companies use automation tools.
Very few actually trust them.

When workflows break, leads are lost, data goes out of sync, and founders become the emergency contact. Tools don’t own outcomes — people do.

TheOneEye exists to close that gap.

We design, run, and maintain custom automations using a configurable execution platform that can accomplish almost any task via node-based workflows — including API calls, browser automation, data processing, AI/ML inference, and decision logic. The platform is extensible, allowing us to develop custom nodes for any system or requirement. Our team actively monitors workflows, handles failures, and fixes issues when systems change — so founders don't have to.

This is not a DIY platform.
It’s a **managed automation service**.

Clients don’t buy software.
They buy reliability, accountability, and peace of mind.

When something breaks, **we own it**.
