### What I’m Looking For in This Role (Clarified)

I’m the founder of **TheOneEye**, but currently I’m also a full-time employee at **12thWonder**. I’m allowed to use 12thWonder’s resources to work on TheOneEye—client acquisition, development, and experimentation.

My core struggle is **thinking and executing long-term strategy while operating day-to-day**. I need a person who can help bridge that gap.

I’m looking for someone who can **think in second-order and long-term leverage**, not just short-term delivery.

---

### Core Expectation

I want a person who can:

* Guide *what to build today* in a way that
  **appears beneficial to the client**,
  **is genuinely beneficial to the client**,
  **but is 2× more beneficial to TheOneEye in the long run**.

This person should constantly ask:

> “If we are doing this work anyway, how does TheOneEye compound value from it over time?”

---

### How I Think About “2× Benefit” (Concrete Example)

**Example: Sales Navigator Plugin**

* For the **client**:

  * A plugin that scores LinkedIn profiles based on intent, activity, and relevance.
  * Helps them identify the right prospects faster.

* For **TheOneEye (long-term leverage)**:

  * Every profile the client visits is also:

    * Parsed (headline, experience, activity, content)
    * Structured
    * Stored (with consent-safe design) in our own system
  * Over time, this builds:

    * A massive intent-labeled profile database
    * Zero direct acquisition cost
    * Data moat for future products, models, and platforms

No one loses.
The client gets value **now**.
TheOneEye compounds value **forever**.

This kind of thinking should be *intentional*, not accidental.

### What This Person Should Actually Do

I need someone who can:

* Think in **systems, flywheels, and compounding advantages**
* Design **small present-day actions** that unlock **large future leverage**
* Translate vague long-term vision into:

  * Clear initiatives
  * Side-effects we intentionally capture
  * Assets TheOneEye owns over time (data, infra, insights, patterns)
* Act as a **strategic amplifier**, not just an executor
* Help me avoid building “one-off client solutions” with no long-term upside

---

### In Simple Terms

I’m not looking for:

* Just a developer
* Just a product manager
* Just a consultant

I’m looking for someone who can **co-plan the future of TheOneEye while executing in the present**, making sure that:

> Every client project quietly pushes TheOneEye closer to its long-term vision.
